## 🎯 Use Case Examples

- **Tailscale:** `ssh user@192.168.1.50` (direct access)
- **WireGuard:** `ssh user@192.168.1.50` (through VPN)
- **Cloudflare Tunnel:** Need SSH tunnel configuration

### Scenario 3: Access Router Admin
- **Tailscale:** `http://192.168.1.1` (direct access)
- **WireGuard:** `http://192.168.1.1` (through VPN)
